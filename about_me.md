## About Me

![Headshot](/headshot.jpg)

Hi! My name is Amina Brown. I'm currently a student in the Data Visualization masters program at Parsons School of Design at the New School. 
My background is in Math and Data Science, having studied Mathematics at the University of Vermont and then going on to work as a 
Data Scientist in the Wellness Technology industry for two and a half years. By pursuing my masters degree, I am hoping to transition into more
Information Design work rather than traditional Data Science. I love the idea of using visuals (and other representations) to help communicate
data driven information to diverse audiences. While most of my work is done digitally, I also like to explore making physical data representations. Head to my [projects page](https://amina-brown.github.io/projects.html) to see examples of my work!
